We will have a separate platform where we will deal with crypto to fiat transactions in the local currency denoted as South African Rand (ZAR). DBEX functions as a trading platform provider and is not a buyer or seller in trades made between traders. DBEX is also not a market maker. Traders must register and open an account with DBEX and deposit digital assets prior to commencement of trading. Traders may request the withdrawal of their digital assets, subject to the limitations as stated in the Terms and Conditions.

</div><div>

DBEX will not ask for any password from its users nor ask users to transfer funds that are not listed on its trading platform.
